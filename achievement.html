<h1>MY ACHIEVEMENT</h1>
 My name is saad aishat,i went to fgco odogbolu i was a social prefect girl during my ss3 and i was also the assistant class captain.<br>
I started learning tailoring at the age of 15years,and at the age of 25 i did freedom from where i went tailoring so as at that<br>
time i became a boss on my own.at 2014 i got an admission into kwara state polytechnic where i did my national diploma[ND] where i studied
public administration and i finished my ND at the year 2016/2017.and after completing my ND i took another jamb which i applied for admission at KWASU
and at the year 2018 i got an admission into kwara state university,malete[kwasu].<br>
where i was given an admission to study library and information science although the course i applied for was public administration but
unfortunately i was given library and information science which at first i wanted to reject the admision but i thought it could be an oppotunity for me to
learn more.
